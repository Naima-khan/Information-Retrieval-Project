Soldier Chased by Wasps, Then Hit and Killed by Cars

(NEWSER) – A soldier stationed at Fort Campbell in Tennessee died after wandering into traffic on a major highway early Monday, the Tennessean reports. Austin McGeough, 21, died after being hit by several cars on Highway 41-A in Pleasant View. Detectives working the case believe McGeough was under the influence of crushed Percocet and alcohol, a combination that intoxicated and disoriented him to the point where he didn't know where he was.

After consuming the drugs and alcohol at a party, McGeough broke into a nursery, where he dislodged a wasp's nest and was chased around by the angry inhabitants. Fifteen minutes after calling 911 about the wasps, McGeough leaned out into traffic on the highway in an attempt to hail a car; instead he was struck by a car and then run over by several successive vehicles. The first car stopped, but the following ones did not, WKRN reports.
