Thrown From Car, Infant Found Safe in Storm Drain
(NEWSER) – Some are calling it a Thanksgiving miracle, per People. Police say an 18-wheeler clipped a car on Interstate 30 in Texarkana, Ark., around 7pm Friday, causing the vehicle to flip and an 8-month-old girl to be ejected. Her car seat was found outside the vehicle, but the infant wasn't in it, reports CNN. Firefighters who feared they were on a recovery mission were later searching a patch of hay within the interstate median when a sound directed them to a small storm drain barely visible about 25 feet from the crash site. Inside, the infant "was sitting up and looking up at us waiting for us to pull her out," a firefighter tells KSLA. "She wasn't screaming, she wasn't crying, was just sitting there waiting for us" with a scratch on her forehead, he adds.

Firefighters believe the infant rolled down a hill and into the storm drain. Incredibly, she was taken to a hospital and found to have suffered only a minor injury. "There had to be some kind of divine intervention for her to end up being OK," the firefighter says. Authorities say the child wasn't properly secured in her car seat, which itself wasn't properly installed in the car, but police issued no citations over that. None of the four others from the car suffered serious injuries, while the driver of the 18-wheeler has been cited for an improper lane change.
