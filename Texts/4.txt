Baltimore School Bus Crash 'Sounded Like a Trainwreck'

(NEWSER) – Police are investigating a Tuesday morning crash in Southwest Baltimore between a school bus and a commuter bus that left six dead, the Baltimore Sun reports. No children were reportedly on the school bus, but the driver of that bus died, while five people on the MTA bus perished, Baltimore Police spokesman TJ Smith said at a Tuesday presser. "Significant injuries" were also reported, per Smith, who advised via Twitter that it's a "fluid situation" and that he doesn't yet have info on those who died.

The superintendent of a nearby cemetery tells the Sun the crash—which reportedly involved the school bus first slamming into another car and a cemetery pillar before hitting the MTA bus—"sounded like a trainwreck." Cops say the crash took place around 6:30am, per CNN. Smith, who said the "horrific" accident was among the worst he's ever seen in his career, per NBC4, sent out a gentle reminder via Twitter message to the media to be "mindful" of the fact that there were fatalities and to "consider your own children and loved ones as you film."
