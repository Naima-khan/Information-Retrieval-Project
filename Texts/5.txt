2 Kids, 1 Adult Die in Halloween Hayride Tragedy

(NEWSER) – A vehicle struck a hay-lined flatbed trailer carrying adults and children who were dressed up for Halloween, killing three people and injuring several others in a small Mississippi town, authorities say. Two children and one adult—all related to each other—were killed in the crash, Newton County Coroner Danny Shoemaker said late Monday. Their names and ages were not immediately released. "It was just chaos," Shoemaker tells the AP, describing the scene of the wreck on US Highway 80 in Chunky, a town near the Alabama border, about 80 miles east of Jackson.

Halloween hayrides are a tradition in Chunky, which has a population of around 325, reports the Washington Post. "It's a small community. This is a bad thing to happen anywhere, but when it's local, it really hits home," Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Andy West tells WTOK. "These are good people, and our hearts go out to them," he says. West says a Ford F-150 pickup truck apparently rear-ended the trailer, which was being pulled by another vehicle, while both vehicles were traveling westbound.
