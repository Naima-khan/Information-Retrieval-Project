Strangers Form Human Chain, Rescue Driver From Flames
(NEWSER) – A man in Florida is alive today after a group of strangers formed a human chain and helped police get him out of a burning vehicle. Police in Brevard County say the driver of an SUV hit another car on US 1 about 11am Sunday, then careened down an embankment, where his vehicle caught fire, reports WESH. Witnesses and police were on the scene quickly, including bystander Tom Sais. "Start climbing on through and there he was up in the air, hanging still strapped into his seat belt, hanging sideways," he recalls, per ClickOrlando.com. Dramatic video captures a woman yelling, "We need angels, Lord. Help us get him! You will not die!" reports the Orlando Sentinel.

Two officers and two bystanders got him out of the vehicle, but then struggled to make it up the embankment. After a cry of "Make a chain!" people linked arms and pulled the man to safety. The driver was hospitalized with minor injuries and will undergo a psychological evaluation because police say he actually fought against his own rescue. "If it weren't for all the bystanders that helped our officers, it could have been a very bad situation, but now it's going to be a great story as soon as he recovers from his injuries," says a police spokeswoman in Palm Bay. (This Good Samaritan act backfired comically.)
